# Predicting Boston Housing Prices (Udacity MLND)

## Project Overview
In this project, I am applying basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) area to predict the selling price of a new home. 

Things I have learned by completing this project:

- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.


## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)


This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where all the code is written to predict the accurate housing price in Boston.
-  `report.html`: This file is HTML representation of actual code and easy to access through web browser
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. 
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.
